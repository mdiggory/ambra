<h1>Help with Ambra Accounts</h1>
<p>You may read Ambra journals without creating an account.  However, an account is required to comment on articles. Accounts are free.</p>

<h3>Create Account</h3>
<p><a href="${context}/register.action" title="Create Ambra Profile">Create an Ambra account</a>.  A confirmation will be sent to your e-mail address with the title "Please verify your PLoS registration".  Use the URL in that e-mail to complete your registration.</p>

<h3>Login</h3>
<p>The "Login" or "My Profile" is available near the top right corner of every journal page.</p>

<p>The first time you log in, you are required to create a profile with basic information, with which you will be identified whenever you rate or comment on an article. As part of your profile, you must choose a username. Your username is attached to all commentary that you make on the PLoS web sites. This means that all your commentary is credited and attributed to you. <strong>You cannot change your username.</strong> It is possible to get a new username by registering for a whole new account, but anything you have done on your original account will not transfer to the new account with the new username.</p>

<h3>Lost Password</h3>
<p>If you have forgotten your password, go to <a href="${context}/forgotPassword.action" title="Ambra Profile Password Reminder">the password reminder page</a>, enter your E-mail address, and click "Submit". An e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address you use to log in to your PLoS user account.  </p>
