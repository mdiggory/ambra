  This file contains most of the defaults for the ambra webapp. However, there may be additional
  defaults in the conf-helper library's global-defaults.xml. Additionally, if in dev mode, some
  of these values may be overridden by settings in defaults-dev.xml. Finally, look for overrides
  in /etc/ambra/ambra.xml.
