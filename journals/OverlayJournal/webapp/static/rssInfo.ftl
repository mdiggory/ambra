  <h2>What is an RSS feed?</h2>

  <p>
    An <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss" title="Technology at Harvard Law | RSS 2.0 Specification">RSS</a>
    (Really Simple Syndication) feed is a regularly published collection of headlines and summaries
    from an original source (e.g., an Ambra journal).  Readers can subscribe to their favorite RSS feeds to have the latest
    news and content updates delivered right to their desktop.  To do so, you will need an RSS feed reader.  See the
    section below on <a href="#howcaniread">reading RSS feeds</a> for more information.
