  <h2>1. Rating Categories</h2>

  <p>
    Ambra allows users to rate articles for subjective "quality". Scientific work can be measured on a number of scales. To reflect this, research articles can be rated in three separate categories: Insight, Reliability, and Style. Rating is done on a 1 to 5 scale with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest rating.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Insight:</strong> This provides a measure of how thought-provoking a user found
      an article or how much it advances our scientific understanding. The scale for
      <em>Insight</em> ranges from 1, <em>Bland</em>, a report which provides no more than an
      incremental advance on the published literature; to 5, <em>Profound</em>, a report which
      substantially deepens or alters current thinking.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reliability:</strong> This provides a measure of how secure a user feels the results
      and conclusion in a study are. The scale for <em>Reliability</em> ranges from 1,
      <em>Tenuous</em>, the study is preliminary and will need confirmation; to 5,
      <em>Unassailable</em>, the results are of high quality, the reasoning is tight, and the
      conclusions are completely solid.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Style:</strong> This provides a measure of how well performed and presented a user
      considers a study to be. The scale for <em>Style</em> ranges from 1, <em>Crude</em>, the
      technical accomplishment and presentation of the study is adequate at best; to 5,
      <em>Elegant</em>, the study satisfyingly presents the results of technically accomplished
      and expertly executed experiments.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Users can rate articles in any or all categories; the ratings given are combined to give an overall rating from that user. Note that Front Matter articles, such as Editorials, Perspectives, and Reviews, can only be given a single overall rating.
  </p>

  <p>
	Ratings from all users are combined to give average ratings in each category and a combined overall rating. The number of users who have rated an article is also displayed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Users can also supply comments to accompany their rating of an article. These can be used to
    explain the ratings given. Unlike other forms of comment, rating comments cannot be used as
    the beginning of a discussion thread. The comment field is optional; however, comments cannot
    be made unless the user also rates the article in at least one category.
  </p>

  <a id="who" name="who"></a>
  <h2>2. Who Can Rate?</h2>

  <p>
    All registered users are able to rate any article. Anyone can register as a user. Users are required to unambiguously identify themselves and to supply a valid e-mail address in order to register. Rating is not anonymous.
  </p>

  <a id="view" name="view"></a>
  <h2>3. Viewing Ratings and Rating Comments</h2>

  <p>
    The overall "Average Rating" for an article is displayed on the bottom of the Metrics tab page for all articles. Also displayed is the number of users who have rated the article; "User Ratings" links to a page containing the individual ratings from each user as well as any comments they have included.
  </p>

  <a id="how" name="how"></a>
  <h2>4. How to Rate</h2>

  <p>
    To rate an article first make sure you are logged into the Web site. Then, click on the Metrics tab of the article. In the ratings section near the bottom of the page, click on "Rate This Article" link. This will open a separate window within which you can select your desired number of rating stars for the study and enter any comments that you may wish to accompany your rating. Once completed, you will be returned to the metrics page. Ratings and rating comments can be modified at any time by following the "edit my rating" link on the Metrics tab page.

  <h2>5. Requesting Review of Inappropriate Content</h2>

  <p>
    To request review of a comment you believe to be inappropriate, or if you suspect that the rating system is being abused, click the "Request review" link in the bottom-right corner of the rating. Indicate why the rating should be reviewed ("Spam," "Offensive," "Inappropriate," or "Other"), enter additional information in the text box, and click "Submit".
