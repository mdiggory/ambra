    The FileStoreService is a "thin" API wrapper used to abstract access to the
    publishing systems basic persistent data storage. All of the data in the
    publishing system can be uniquely identified using the Digital Object
    Identifier (DOI). The DOI is used as the basis to find all article xml, images,
    supplemental data, manifest xml, article pdf etc. The API makes no assumptions
    about these id's other than they must be unique. The underlying implementations
    will map these id's to whatever devices it uses for persistent storage.
</p>
<p>
    The API provides an interface to the underlying filestore implementation which
    will vary depending on the size of the filestore, performance and replication
    characteristics the site needs to serve its users. A simple implementations
    would be a direct mapping of the DOI to a filename. A more complex and
    robust implementation might use a networked based filestore such as MogileFS
    that supports replication and direct access via http.
</p>
<p>
    The filestore does not store meta-data. This allows simple
    and efficient implementation for most of the possible underlying implementations.
    Also filestores may or may not allow direct access via HTTP header  XReproxy
    commands.

    <b>IMPORTANT</b>

    <li>
        The underlying store does not report prior existence of a file. If you store a
        file using an ID that already exist the previous file associated with that ID
        will be overwritten.
    </li>
    <li>
        Only one file with the same ID may be written at the same time. It is up to the
    application to insure this.
    </li>
    <li>
        ID's must be unique, do not have spaces, do not have special characters other than
        '/', '.', '-', '_'  and can have characters [A-Za-z] or numbers [0-9]. When in doubt
        leave it out.
